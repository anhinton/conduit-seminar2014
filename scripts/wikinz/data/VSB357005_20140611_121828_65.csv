"Footnotes:"
"From September 1995, birth and death registrations collected ethnicity based on self-identification, rather than degree-of-blood."
"Until 30 August 1995, a stillbirth was defined as a child born dead after 28 weeks of pregnancy. From 1 September 1995, a child is stillborn when it is dead at birth and either weighs 400g or more at birth, or is born after the 20th week of pregnancy."
"Births and deaths data are based on date of registration (not date of occurrence). Data before 1991 includes New Zealand residents and overseas visitors. Data from 1991 includes New Zealand residents only."
"Apart from some historical data, births exclude late registrations under section 16 of the Births, Deaths, Marriages, and Relationships Registration Act 1995."
