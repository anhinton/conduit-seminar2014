mortality. Note: The maternal mortality series records very small
numbers so there may be large annual fluctuations, particularly in
countries with low population levels. New Zealand data on maternal
deaths includes both Direct and Indirect Obstetric Deaths, e.g. those
caused by direct complications during pregnancy, labour & puerperium
as well as those caused by previous existing disease that was
aggravated by the physiological effects of pregnancy.
